**Linkor** is a Korean tutor matching app for multicultural families living in South Korea to improve their Korean language skills.


## ‚úè Introduction
In Korea, the number of multicultural families is continuously increasing, exceeding 400,000 households as of 2022. The school strives to provide a variety of Korean education. However, still there are students having difficulty using Korean in school. So, we wanted to create an app for resolving inequality and providing quality education. We propose **Linkor**, an app that supports Korean education tutoring.
**Linkor** means Link + Korean, which links students and tutors with korean education. Tutors will volunteer tutoring in this app.


Through **"Linkor"**, we hope that members of multicultural families living in Korea can easily learn Korean and overcome the language barriers.

Our team chose two UN Sustainable Development Goals - **SDG4: Quality Education** and **SDG10: Reduced Inequalities**.
This app will provide quality education to multicultural students, and reduce inequalities which they can face in using Korean.
